#Understanding Controllers

* View controller – Displays a blank screen
* Navigation Controller – Displays other views on the screen with back buttons automatically displayed in the upper left corner
* Table View Controller – Displays a table view on the screen
* Collection View Controller – Displays a Collection View on the screen
* Tab bar controller – Displays other views on the screen, accessible through tabs at the bottom of the screen
* Split View Controller – Displays two views on the screen at the same time
* Page View Controller – Displays other views like pages in a book
* GLKit View Controller – Displays a view for showing graphics based on the OpenGL cross-platform graphics library (Apple has mostly switched to its own Metal graphics library, so OpenGL is largely obsolete and is provided for backward compatibility with older apps that still use OpenGL.)
* AVKit player View Controller – Displays a view for displaying video on the screen
